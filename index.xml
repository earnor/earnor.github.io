      <title>Responsiveness of infrastructure planning - Embracing adaptive planning methods to meet societal needs</title>
      <link>https://earnor.github.io/project/responsiveness/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure is continually constructed and modified to meet changing needs of stakeholders. However, this is sometimes completed later than expected, resulting in unmet stakeholder needs for unnecessarily long periods. This delay is related to long duration of the planning process, length of time during which infrastructure is to be used and uncertainty associated with change in stakeholder needs over time. Improvement in speed with which changing needs can be met is likely to yield substantial benefits for stakeholders. The responsiveness of infrastructure planning organisations describes their ability to meet stakeholder needs quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research (1) maps the planning process of the relevant decision-makers planning regional transport infrastructure in practice, (2) identifies the potential of adaptive planning methods in planning practice, (3) develops state-of-the-art tools to plan regional infrastructure development considering future uncertainties, e.g., impact of automated, connected and electric vehicles and the complex interactions between mobility, infrastructure and land use.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On accessibility and infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://earnor.github.io/post/2021-06-24-accessibility-and-infrastructure/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 24 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://earnor.github.io/post/2021-06-24-accessibility-and-infrastructure/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that when decision-makers want to build infrastructure for transportation in urban areas, the discussion gets very heated. Land is scarce – so users, all of a sudden, become spokespeople for each mode which they most often use, fighting that enough land is provided to their mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways this politicisation and discussion can be very positive because we appreciate the different perspectives when it comes to evaluating building long-lasting infrastructure. For this appreciation to be the case, different users and eventually their elected representatives must be able to understand and empathise with different needs of different modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe we need to also see that we shouldn’t be fighting for land, we should be fighting for more access to land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last 120 years, the cars have enabled normal people great things and increased the opportunities they have, in other words, a motorised vehicle has increased the accessibility of pretty much everyone. Metaphorically speaking, the world has become smaller right in front of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the image below a map of Switzerland is shown. The cells are distorted dependent on the travel time across the cells. A travel time of one hour stays constant, so a smaller map, means faster travel. The maps between 1950 and 2000 are compared (Axhausen, 2008).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;The world is shrinking&amp;rdquo;: The image shows the reduction in travel time necessary between 1950 and 2000&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-fallback&#34; data-lang=&#34;fallback&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;Accessibility is a term often used in transport and land-use planning, and is generally understood to mean approximately ’ease of reaching’. Accessibility is concerned with the opportunity that on individual or type of person at a given location possesses to take part in a particular activity or set of activities.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, this has also provided the opportunity to move further away from the city, which provides lower cost of housing and commute to work. However, as more people can afford to do this, and population further grows, this leads to traffic congestions on the highways causing slower traffic, increased delays etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As central business districts (CBDs) get less accessible, the companies generally react by moving jobs elsewhere, ceteris parabus. There are many reasons why companies decide their locaton and prefer to cluster with other firms, but the accessibility to a staff pool is an important one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the user: After the arrival of the automobile, there was clearly a leap for lower costs and improved accessibility based on the car infrastructure. As we see congested roads and revitalised cities, it is observed that this did not pay off for those families who invested in housing in the sub-urbs and travel long distances with car to their job. The accessibility to jobs is less in these cities. So what is the solution?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent Open Access paper published in Nature’s Urban Sustainability by Wu &amp;amp; colleagues approached infrastructure networks from a very interesting point of view. They looked at the accessibility to jobs in different cities calculated for different modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two things I’d like to highlight:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is less surprising, is that Dutch cities, famous for their cycling infrastructure, and other European cities such as Vienna, Krakow and Paris are among those cities with the highest accessibility to jobs &lt;em&gt;by bike&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;by walking&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Access to jobs by walking (above) and by cycling (below) //Pictures from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s42949-021-00020-2&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Wu et al. (2021)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second: A very interesting result in this paper, is that the Dutch cities also score very highly for the accessibility to jobs &lt;em&gt;by car&lt;/em&gt; and score higher than other cities, which have focused less on “slow-mode” infrastructure. A lot of the heated debate on cycling infrastructure investment mentioned above, however, bases on the “fact” that more cycling infrastructure takes space away from cars, which can only be bad. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper shows evidence that more cycling accessibility (provided by increased infrastructure and policy) correlates with more accessibility overall meaning that they complement each other very well. My hypothesis is that this happens because both people and their jobs stay in the “centers” of cities when people are provided with mobility opportunities, be it by car, bicycle or transit. This also makes it more interesting as a company to stay in CBDs as the staff pool is retained in those areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we do not improve peoples’ opportunities by maximising efficiency of one mode – but rather providing choices for mobility.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Removing highways - Solution or a disservice?</title>
      <link>https://earnor.github.io/post/2021-05-27-removing-highways/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 27 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://earnor.github.io/post/2021-05-27-removing-highways/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/05/27/climate/us-cities-highway-removal.html?ref=oembed&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; was posted on the New York Times suggesting that in order to revive urban centers all over the United States, many cities are considering removing high-volume roads and highways from the city center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When discussing the traffic impacts of such interventions, the narrative prevails that little impact on traffic levels is seen on neighboring roads at first glance. However, this does not necessarily mean that the planners are not causing a disservice within the network from a transportation point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an urban development point of view large highways have a very segregating effect. Physically, these become barriers of social engagement. Pedestrians are much less likely to cross highways than single-lane urban roads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Socioeconomically, highways can depreciate the value of real estate in their vicinity, at the same time as the appreciate the value of sub-urban real estate because of the improvement in accessibility between sub-urban neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessibility is a term often used in transport and land-use planning, and is generally understood to mean approximately ’ease of reaching’. Accessibility is concerned with the opportunity that on individual or type of person at a given location possesses to take part in a particular activity or set of activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the NYT article illustrates, there exists massive potential in urban redevelopment through the removal of these highways, encouraging walking, improving the green areas and start creating communities instead of offering them “a highway and go directly out of our community” This could however lead to clear consequences on the traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors shrug this off by writing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;and-the-big-fear-of-removing-a-highway--terrible-traffic--hasnt-materialized&#34;&gt;And the big fear of removing a highway — terrible traffic — hasn’t materialized.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s be clear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From an urban development point of view (p.o.v.), the removal of highways has positive effects on the life of those living in close vicinity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From a transport behavior p.o.v., it can be logical that “terrible traffic” will not materialise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People are very adaptable and if they have less choice, they still optimise their travel behavior, given the opportunities they are provided with, although the choices today may be worse than yesterday.
From a transport planning standpoint, removing a highway can be quite significant. If news articles like this, or review articles suggest a narrative that claims it has no impact on traffic, or even that it “disappears”, such claims are, at best, misleading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where does the traffic go? Let’s consider an example.
















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;png&#34; srcset=&#34;

               /post/2021-05-27-removing-highways/fig1_hu4b619c9d27215034114df1b75f375312_5096_1200x1200_fit_q75_h2_lanczos_3.webp 1200w&#34;
               src=&#34;https://earnor.github.io/post/2021-05-27-removing-highways/fig1_hu4b619c9d27215034114df1b75f375312_5096_6ef73895281c9b829758b48a36ea67f4.webp&#34;
               width=&#34;686&#34;
               height=&#34;211&#34;
               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;em&gt;An example network with shopping opportunities available for a resident, living at node A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s consider neighborhoods A, B and C. They are linked with links 1-4. At nodes B and C we have large supermarkets, whereas node A is served by a cornershop. The planners suggest to remove highway 1 because residents in between A and B are severely affected by noise and the highway splits up a school neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to removing the highway, the planners measure the traffic on neighboring roads 2 and 3 which are much slower than the highway 1 because they lead you through smaller roads. These counts on road 2 and 3 see little change after the highway has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those residents of neighborhood A who before the highway removal did their shopping at supermarket in B will, instead of traveling through narrow roads 2 and 3, either settle for the corner shop in A or travel further to C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;png&#34; srcset=&#34;

               /post/2021-05-27-removing-highways/fig1_hu4b619c9d27215034114df1b75f375312_5096_1200x1200_fit_q75_h2_lanczos_3.webp 1200w&#34;
               src=&#34;https://earnor.github.io/post/2021-05-27-removing-highways/fig1_hu4b619c9d27215034114df1b75f375312_5096_6ef73895281c9b829758b48a36ea67f4.webp&#34;
               width=&#34;686&#34;

               loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;em&gt;The same network as above except a link between A and B has been removed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ergo, while it is true that we may not measure an increase in traffic on neighboring roads 2 and 3, as suggested by this article or in some scientific findings, this does not exclude the idea that we have actually reduced the accessibility within the network and may lead to a disservice within the network. We should not ignore, or belittle that effect. However, the service provided by a park or other opportunity replacing the highway may be larger from an urban planning standpoint than the disservice in the reduction of accessibility from a transportation standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This small thought experiment highlights the necessity for urban planners, transport planners and infrastructure planners to work together. This can improve our cities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hello R Markdown</title>
      <link>https://earnor.github.io/post-archive/2020-12-01-r-rmarkdown/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;r-markdown&#34;&gt;R Markdown&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see &lt;a href=&#34;http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can embed an R code chunk like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34; data-lang=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;##      speed           dist       &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;fit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;lm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;dist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;~&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;speed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;cars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;fit&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;## &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;## Call:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;## lm(formula = dist ~ speed, data = cars)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;## &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;## Coefficients:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;## (Intercept)        speed  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;c1&#34;&gt;##     -17.579        3.932&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;including-plots&#34;&gt;Including Plots&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also embed plots. See Figure &lt;a href=&#34;#fig:pie&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34; data-lang=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;par&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;mar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;pie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;280&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;nf&#34;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Sky&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Sunny side of pyramid&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;s&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Shady side of pyramid&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;  &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;init.angle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;m&#34;&gt;-50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;border&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;kc&#34;&gt;NA&lt;/span&gt;

      <title>Writing technical content in Markdown</title>
      <link>https://earnor.github.io/post-archive/writing-technical-content/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://earnor.github.io/post-archive/writing-technical-content/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hugo Blox Builder is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience. You can focus on the content and Wowchemy handles the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Highlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this page, you&amp;rsquo;ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Wowchemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;examples&#34;&gt;Examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;code&#34;&gt;Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can customize the styles under the &lt;code&gt;syntax_highlighter&lt;/code&gt; option in your &lt;code&gt;config/_default/params.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv(&amp;quot;data.csv&amp;quot;)
data.head()
```
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;renders as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;kn&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;pandas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;k&#34;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;nn&#34;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;read_csv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;s2&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;data.csv&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;o&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;n&#34;&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;p&#34;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;mindmaps&#34;&gt;Mindmaps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply insert a Markdown &lt;code&gt;markmap&lt;/code&gt; code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
```markmap {height=&#34;200px&#34;}
- Hugo Modules
  - wowchemy
  - blox-plugins-netlify
  - blox-plugins-netlify-cms
  - blox-plugins-reveal
```
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;renders as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;markmap&#34; style=&#34;height: 200px;&#34;&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;- Hugo Modules
  - wowchemy
  - blox-plugins-netlify
  - blox-plugins-netlify-cms
  - blox-plugins-reveal&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;
&lt;code&gt;
```markmap

    - Math: $x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}$&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;charts&#34;&gt;Charts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wowchemy supports the popular &lt;a href=&#34;https://plot.ly/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Plotly&lt;/a&gt; format for interactive charts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example &lt;code&gt;line-chart.json&lt;/code&gt;, and then add the &lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; chart data=&amp;quot;line-chart&amp;quot; &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt; shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demo:&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;div id=&#34;chart-823417965&#34; class=&#34;chart&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  (function() {
    let a = setInterval( function() {
      if ( typeof window.Plotly === &#39;undefined&#39; ) {
        return;
      }
      clearInterval( a );

      Plotly.d3.json(&#34;./line-chart.json&#34;, function(chart) {
        Plotly.plot(&#39;chart-823417965&#39;, chart.data, chart.layout, {responsive: true});
      });
    }, 500 );
  })();
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might also find the &lt;a href=&#34;http://plotly-json-editor.getforge.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Plotly JSON Editor&lt;/a&gt; useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;math&#34;&gt;Math&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the &lt;code&gt;math&lt;/code&gt; option in your &lt;code&gt;config/_default/params.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To render &lt;em&gt;inline&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;block&lt;/em&gt; math, wrap your LaTeX math with &lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; math &amp;gt;}}$...${{&amp;lt; /math &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;{{&amp;lt; math &amp;gt;}}$$...$${{&amp;lt; /math &amp;gt;}}&lt;/code&gt;, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy &lt;em&gt;math&lt;/em&gt; shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The &lt;em&gt;math&lt;/em&gt; shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example &lt;strong&gt;math block&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; class=&#34;chroma&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-latex&#34; data-lang=&#34;latex&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;line&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;cl&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;{{&lt;/span&gt;&amp;lt; math &amp;gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nb&#34;&gt;}}&lt;/span&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure is continually constructed and modified to meet changing needs of stakeholders. However, this is sometimes completed later than expected, resulting in unmet stakeholder needs for unnecessarily long periods. This delay is related to long duration of the planning process, length of time during which infrastructure is to be used and uncertainty associated with change in stakeholder needs over time. Improvement in speed with which changing needs can be met is likely to yield substantial benefits for stakeholders. The responsiveness of infrastructure planning organisations describes their ability to meet stakeholder needs quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research (1) maps the planning process of the relevant decision-makers planning regional transport infrastructure in practice, (2) identifies the potential of adaptive planning methods in planning practice, (3) develops state-of-the-art tools to plan regional infrastructure development considering future uncertainties, e.g., impact of automated, connected and electric vehicles and the complex interactions between mobility, infrastructure and land use.&lt;/p&gt;
